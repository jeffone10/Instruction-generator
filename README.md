[![Download Instruction-generator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Instruction--generator-brightgreen)](https://github.com/jeffone10/Instruction-generator/releases)

## 📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build an **automated tool that generates step-by-step user manual guides for any website** by converting them into clear, professional documentation. This tool helps users create manuals without the usual manual effort by automatically capturing actions, understanding the user interface, and producing downloadable documentation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Creating user manuals is traditionally:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Difficult to maintain with UI changes

These challenges result in delays and inconsistencies in user guidance. 

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview
The Instruction-generator works by:

1. Capturing user interactions on a website, including clicks, navigation, and inputs.
2. Capturing relevant UI screenshots during these interactions.
3. Extracting meaningful context from the user interface.
4. Converting raw interaction logs into structured, readable steps.
5. Generating a downloadable **PDF user manual** that you can easily share with users.

This streamlined process simplifies how companies document their websites.

## 🎯 Intended Use Cases
- Product documentation teams looking for automated solutions
- Quality assurance (QA) and testing teams in need of clear documentation
- SaaS onboarding documentation to guide new users
- Internal process documentation for training purposes
